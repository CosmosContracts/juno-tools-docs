# Contributing

## Collaboration

Junotools is an open-source project, you are welcome to any kind of contribution. Be it a small bug fix, a typo, or a completely new contract to the dashboard. Your contributions will grow the project and the whole ecosystem.

If you need help, you can get support at the JunoTools channel on [Juno Discord.](https://discord.com/invite/juno)

Feedback can also be done through the discord channel and GitHub issues.

If your chain needs tools, contact us through the discord or DMs. Since the code is open-source, feel free to fork, use and contribute.
