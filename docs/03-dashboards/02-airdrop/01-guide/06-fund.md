# Fund

The airdrop is active, the only thing left is to fund it.

However, the process of airdropping CW-20 tokens and native token is a bit different. Both are explained below.

## CW20

CW20 Tokens are only airdroppable by minting, only the minter of the token can fund the airdrop.

## Native Token

As native tokens are not owned by anyone, you can fund the airdrop by directly transferring your $JUNO tokens.

After the airdrop is funded and the specified start time has passed, the airdrop will be claimable.
