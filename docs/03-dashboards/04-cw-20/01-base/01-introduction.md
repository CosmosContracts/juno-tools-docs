# Introduction

## What's a CW20 Token?

CW20 is a specification for fungible tokens based on CosmWasm. The name and design are loosely based on Ethereum's ERC20 standard, but many changes have been made. The types here can be imported by contracts that wish to implement this spec or by contracts that call to any standard CW20 contract.

## JunoTools and CW20

JunoToools provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with CW20 tokens without coding.

Using JunoTools you can:
- instantiate,
- query,
- and execute CW20 contracts. 

All without paying any **extra** fees.
