# Introduction

## Snapshot service by STAKECRAFT Validator

Snapshot service can be used by any validator to significantly reduce the time it takes to (re)deploy a node. Preloading a shared network snapshot takes much less time to synchronize the operator’s node with the network. Current v1 of STAKECRAFT Snapshot service updates once a day at 00:00 UTC.

## Additional information
You can find out more information such as the size of the archive and its hash sum on the STAKECRAFT Validator’s [website](https://stakecraft.com)
