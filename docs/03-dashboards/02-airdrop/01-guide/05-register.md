# Register
Now that the contract is deployed, it can be registered to the JunoTools. You will be directed to the airdrop register page automatically.

Here, you'll finalize the registration of the airdrop and start funding the drop.

Press **Register Airdrop** button, then confirm the transaction.

:::tip
It's always a good idea to save the contract address manually in case a browser-related issue occurs, so you won't have to deploy the contract again. This way you can manually register and fund your airdrops.
