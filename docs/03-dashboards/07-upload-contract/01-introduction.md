# Introduction

## What's a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is an executable code that lives on the blockchain. 

One can create any logic, concerning the limitations of the smart contract language, inside a smart contract and interact with it. 

For more information on smart contracts check out the [CosmWasm documentation](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/).

## JunoTools and Smart Contracts

All the tools present on the JunoTools dashboard, whether it be a CW1 or Airdrop tool, are smart contracts. 

As JunoTools aims to simplify the smart contract usage for everyone, including developers, it also provides an easy way to upload your smart contracts to the Juno network.
